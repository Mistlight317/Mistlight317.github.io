        <p>I started playing tennis when I was about 10 years old. I mainly play for fun with friends and family, but I also take lessons at my local tennis center and occasionally participate in tournaments.</p>

        <p>I first learned how to crochet from one of my friends. From there, I watched Youtube videos to get familiar with different types of stitches. Nowadays, I follow written patterns or video tutorials for projects I want to make, some of which you can see in the picture above! </p>
